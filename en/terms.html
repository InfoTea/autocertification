        <p>
          <strong>AutoCertification</strong> provides digital software tools for
          automating the creation of certification documents and reports. The
          product is distributed as a digital software license. No physical
          goods are delivered.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Account and Usage</h2>
        <p>
          You are solely responsible for the data you enter, upload, or generate
          using the product. You must ensure compliance with applicable local
          laws and industry regulations, including those related to data
          protection and certification standards (such as SBKTS in Kazakhstan).
          Any unlawful, fraudulent, or unauthorized use is strictly prohibited.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Payments</h2>
        <p>
          Payments are securely processed by
          <strong>Lemon Squeezy</strong>, acting as the
          <em>Merchant of Record</em> and managing all applicable taxes
          (including VAT). We never store or process customers’ card data on our
          servers.

        <h2>4. Data Ownership</h2>
        <p>
          All operational and generated data (templates, documents, reports)
          remain the exclusive property of the customer. Data is stored within
          the customer’s Google Workspace account (Drive, Docs, Sheets) under
          their direct control and access. The user retains access to their data
          even after termination of the license or cooperation.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Refunds</h2>
        <p>
          Refund requests are accepted within 14 days in cases of technical
          issues that prevent normal use of the product. All refund operations

        <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
          The product is provided “as is” without any warranties, express or
          implied. To the maximum extent permitted by law, our total liability
          shall not exceed the amount paid for the most recent license period.
          We are not responsible for indirect or consequential damages,
          including data loss or business interruption.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Termination</h2>
        <p>
          We reserve the right to suspend or terminate access if the product is
          misused, compromised, or used in violation of these Terms. Upon
          termination, your license is revoked, but you retain ownership of your
          data stored in Google Workspace.
